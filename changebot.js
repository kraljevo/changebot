/*In this repo, write a bot using the GitHub api
that automatically accepts any pull requests to
this repo after X amount of time if the pull request
receives more thumbs up emoji reacts than thumbs
down. Then whenever a new pull request is accepted
to the master branch, the bot should pull the latest
version of the master branch and restart itself
using that code.
